# Why?
My daughter is an introvert, shy and emotional (I am too) therefore I would love to give her tools to improve self-confidence and resilience as I think this is important for her development and will be beneficial later in her life.

# Personal Notes 
## These notes are based on the above reasearch documents and are tailored to my situation. DO NOT USE THESE. Start by deleting my notes, then as you are reading the above reasearch documents make your own notes, tailored to your knowledge and situation. What I know is different to what you know. I skipped a lot of the things from the above reasearch and only included things that are NEW or important to me. You may know all of the below in which case you do not need to note it.
* Break difficult tasks down into small steps and acknowledge effort, progress and achievement. Create a learning culture in which failure is good – getting things wrong is positive as it helps us know what not to do next time![^1]
* Involve children in decision-making and teach them problem-solving skills to increase their sense of competence. Let them take healthy risks so they can learn through experience.[^1]
* One of the ways children develop self-esteem is by hearing good things about themselves. But praise only works if it is specific and believable. If your son plays really badly in a football match and you tell him he played brilliantly it is not believable and it may make him less likely to believe your praise in future. Focus on real achievements and on effort (“I could see that was a really tough match. Well done for not giving up and for battling all the way to then end.”) Constant overblown praise can inhibit learning (child’s conclusion: “I am already good enough“), destroy trust (child’s conclusion: “I don’t believe your opinion of me as it clearly isn’t based on reality“) and undermine self-esteem by creating a fear of failure (child’s conclusion: “I always need to do things perfectly to be approved of“). Equally, harsh negative criticism is likely to have a negative result.[^1]
* If your child is a habitual negative thinker then you might want to do some specific work on teaching optimism.[^1]
* Encouraging children to evaluate their own achievements and set their own goals is a brilliant way of building children’s self-esteem. Setting our own goals and achieving them is empowering. Whereas having goals set for us can be daunting (especially if we already lack self-belief). Your child may set a goal which is woefully small but if they achieve it then they will feel competent and more willing to try again and extend their goal. Whereas if they fail at your stretch target that will confirm their sense of incompetence and make them less likely to try again.[^1]
So, when your child shows you a drawing, ask them what they think of it (“I really like that. Are you pleased with it?“). Similarly, if they tell you an exam result (“How do you feel about that score?“). Key questions to ask include:

    * How do you think you did? / Were you pleased with the result?
    * What did you do well?
    * What could you have done better?
    * Did you do anything differently this time?
    * What will you do differently next time?[^1]

Be positive about initiative (no matter how crazy the idea) and help them break big goals into smaller achievable steps.[^1]

Building children’s self-esteem is not an exact science and all children are different. Use your knowledge of your child and try not to be skewed by how you would think or feel in the same circumstances. Try to remember that self-esteem is a subjective assessment based on a specific interpretation of reality. Telling a child they are wrong in their thinking or just to think differently seldom works. We need to help lead them towards drawing different conclusions.[^1]
*  Avoid personalising (I am to blame), globalising (I always do everything wrong) and catastrophising (I will always do it wrong). If you find yourself falling into these habits, try and substitute explanations that are local and specific and which allow for a different outcome next time (I did this thing wrong because I wasn’t concentrating. I will remember to pay more attention next time so I can get it right). Look on the bright side and find the positive even when things haven’t gone well.[^2]
* Whether things have gone well or badly, the most important question that parents can ask their children is “What will you do differently next time?” Present failure as a natural part of learning that helps us to recognise what we don’t yet know or can’t yet do. Always say what your child did well before you discuss what they could do better. Help them to self-evaluate: “What went well?” “What would you change if you could?” And encourage your child to identify how s/he can influence future events and to develop a plan of action to effect change. [^2]
* When children are anxious about failing, allow them to set their own goals and work out for themselves how to achieve them. Even if they set the bar really low for themselves, if it is an achievable goal that they accomplish by themselves then they will gain a sense of competence that will lead to them setting a more challenging goal next time. Support them to participate in activities where they will experience success. [^2]
* If a child is interpreting events negatively, don’t contradict them but encourage them to come up with six reasons as to why something happened. Why six? Well, it’s quite hard to come up with six personalising, globalising and catastrophizing explanations and there is a good chance that somewhere in there will be one that allows for a locus of control and change. When pressed, for example, Patrick might admit that Olly was also to blame – follow this lead. What did Olly do that contributed to the error? Is there something you and Olly could practise in training that would make that less likely to happen again? What skills does Olly have that might help strengthen your defence in the next game? When will you get a chance to talk to him about that?[^2]
* Not all children’s emotions are logical. Small children ordinarily have fears about the dark, insects, ghosts, kidnappers and getting lost or abandoned. Such fears are common and normal in all young children. Usually children grow out of their fears but sometimes they persist as the child grows up - there are plenty of adults who are anxious about spiders or dogs. __Only when such fears stop your child doing
ordinary activities is there real cause for concern.__ [^3]
* It might feel as if your child clings excessively. Some children are naturally more timid and anxious than others, and for them the stress of new experiences is greater than for other children. However in time this behaviour will usually pass. For other children, however, excessive clinging is a sign that they are extremely anxious. It is important when deciding what is excessive clinging in your child to take into account their nature, as well as what is happening within the child’s immediate environment. However, if your child clings so much that they are unable to play with other children, if they are unable to sleep alone, or be in a different room from you, this might indicate that they are overly anxious.[^3] 

    - My daughter is more timid and anxious than others (I am basing this on my observation and comparing her behavious to other kids on a daily basis). The factors I take into account for this are as follows:
        - immigration: she is a [third culture kid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_culture_kid)
        - lack of siblings: In my opinion, it inhibits her learning of how children interact with each other.
        - genetics: I am myself an introvert and based on mine and my wife's opinions her character is more like mine.

* Parents may worry that other behaviours in young children indicate that they are insecure or worried. However, often these are exactly the opposite. For example, many young children constantly carry comforting pieces of blanket or favourite toys. They do not indicate insecurity and there is nothing to be gained by removing a young child’s comfort object, in fact there are grounds for thinking that children who have comfort objects are better able to cope than those who do not develop the habit.[^3]
