# Let's figure out life together
1. Your life consists of: [Health](https://github.com/5148242e46/5148242e46/tree/main/Health), Relationships and a Job that earns you Money.
2. Whether you know it or not you have Values that define who you are.
3. On top of it you will have some [**Problems**](https://github.com/5148242e46/5148242e46/tree/main/HowToLive) from different areas in your life.
4. If you are a little bit younger you may also have Education to worry about.

Everyone of us is unique and each of us has a different story but all of us have the above in common. 

Some things are outside of our control and we are not going to deal with them here but we can make improvements to our Health, Realtionships, Job, Money, Values, Education and try to solve our Problems. 

Please I would be happy if you could join the discussion about any of the above topics. I believe that together we can figure out life and improve it.
